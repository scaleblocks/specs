# CRUD API Spec 1.0

### Definition
This **CRUD API Spec** describes a generic RESTful API specification to make the traditional entity operations:
- **C**reate
- **R**etrieve (single/multiple)
- **U**pdate (replace/patch)
- **D**elete (soft/hard)

### Objective
The objective of this specification is to aggregate common RESTful CRUD API patterns and other stablished specifications in order to achieve an universal CRUD API format. See [References](#References) for more details

### Inheritance

Except when explicitly overrided, all the "CRUD APIs" implemented in consonance with this specification:
- MUST follow the [HTTP Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)
- SHOULD follow the [REST Architecture Constraints and patterns](https://restfulapi.net/)

## 8. Metadata
<details>
  <summary>General specification</summary>

  ### General specification
  - All entities compliant with this specification 游댮MUST include the metadata information described in this section.
  - Single entities responses 游댮MUST use the appropriate HTTP headers defined in this section to provide metadata information.
  - Entities responses containing either a single or multiple objects, 游리SHOULD include metadata information aggregated inside the `_meta` property.
    - When the `?meta=true` parameter is included in the endpoint URL query, the objects 游댮MUST include the `_meta` property.
  - An entity object 游댯MAY have duplicated metadata information in other entity properties beyond the `_meta` property.
  - Although many API data sources do not have the capability of storing nested objects, thie `_meta` property 游댮MUST be always a nested object regardless the storage implementation.
  - The `_meta` property 游댮MUST be ignored in every write request payload (create, patch, replace). The metadata information is intended to be set by the API server, not the client.
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Versioning and hashing</summary>

  ### Versioning and hashing

  | Header | Value |
  | --- | --- |
  | ETag | `_meta.hash` |
  
  - All entities 游댮MUST include a `_meta.version` property. This property value 游댮MUST start with the number 1 at the object creation and 游댮MUST be incremented by one at every modification of the object (patch or replace operations).
  - All entities 游댮MUST have a `_meta.hash` property. The value 游댮MUST be a hashed string of the concatenation of the shortest value of the `_id` property and the `_meta.version` value (i.e. `[_id.$base64][_meta.version]`. The hashing algorithm 游리SHOULD be CRC32 for optimization.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Timestamps</summary>

  ### Timestamps

  | Header | Value |
  | --- | --- |
  | Last-Modified | `_meta.updated.timestamp` 游댮REQUIRED |
  | Link | `urn:<_meta.updated.author>; rel=author` 游댯OPTIONAL |

  - All entities 游댮MUST include a `_meta.events` property with the following properties:
    - `created`: (游댮REQUIRED) metadata information about the creation event
    - `updated`: (游댮REQUIRED metadata information about the last time the object was modified, including the creation
  - The `created` and `updated` properties 游댮MUST be objects with the following properties:
    - `timestamp` (游댮REQUIRED): a JavaScript date representing when the event occurred
    - `author` (游댯OPTIONAL): the author ID or e-mail of the operation actor, if applicable
    - `reason` (游댯OPTIONAL): the system comments about the operation
    - `comments` (游댯OPTIONAL): the end-user comments about the operation

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Origin</summary>

  ### Origin

  | Header | Value |
  | --- | --- |
  | Link | `<URL>; rel=convertedfrom` 游댯OPTIONAL if it is possible to link using an URL, either absolute or relative |

  - If an entity object was cloned/generated from another object, it 游리SHOULD have a `_meta.origin` property with the following nested properties:
    - `realm`: 游댮MUST be used when the object was cloned/generated from another source. Its value 游리SHOULD be an universal representation of the source, like an Internet Domain Name.
    - `type`: 游댮MUST be used when the source object had a different type than the current object. Its value 游리SHOULD be the name of the foreign entity.
    - `id`: 游댮MUST be used to indicate the original Resource ID.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Lifecycle</summary>

  ### Lifecycle

  Lifecycle is intended to logically express two capabilities of a CRUD API:
  1. Soft-delete
  2. Data staging

  #### The status property
  - Regardless the domain-specific lifecycle status of an entity, the `_meta.status` 游댮MUST NOT be used in any case different than the cases below and any other `_meta.status` values 游댮MUST be ignored by the CRUD API.
  - Documents without the `_meta.status` property 游리SHOULD be considered as "published", "mature" and "integral" versions of the object.

  #### Soft delete
  - Some CRUD APIs are capable of soft-deleting entity objects. This consists in put objects into an "archived" state and separate them off the rest of the entity objects, in order to retain the information for a certain period of time.
  - Regardless if the "archived" objects are stored within the same "unarchived" objects storage, it is a best pratice to mark the objects as archived anyway.
  - To achieve this, a CRUD API with the soft-delete capability 游댮MUST mark the archived objects with the `_meta.status` value set to `"archived"`, as also described in the [DELETE] endpoint.
  - Documents marked with `_meta.status = "archive"` 游리SHOULD NOT be retrieved in read operations unlesss explicitly specified by the client. 

  #### Data staging
  - Some CRUD APIs are capable of "stage" entity objects until they are in a certain maturity stage. Some of these stagings could be drafts of a blog post or even SAGA Patterns applied to entities. Data staging could also be used to perform transactions in copies ("branched objects") before apply modifications to an object.
  - To achieve this, a CRUD API with data staging capability 游댮MUST mark the staging/draft objects with the `_meta.status` value set to `"draft"`.
  - Documents marked with `_meta.status = "draft"` 游리SHOULD NOT be retrieved in read operations unlesss explicitly specified by the client.
