# CRUD API Spec 1.0

### Definition
This **CRUD API Spec** describes a generic RESTful API specification to make the traditional entity operations:
- **C**reate
- **R**etrieve (single/multiple)
- **U**pdate (replace/patch)
- **D**elete (soft/hard)

### Objective
The objective of this specification is to aggregate common RESTful CRUD API patterns and other stablished specifications in order to achieve an universal CRUD API format.

### Inheritance
Except when explicitly overrided, all the "CRUD APIs" implemented inconsonance with this specification:
- MUST follow the [HTTP/1.1 standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)
- SHOULD follow the [REST Architecture Constraints and patterns](https://restfulapi.net/)
